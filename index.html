		<center><h2>Basic Information about Contemporary Taiwan</h2></center>
		<p>Taiwan is currently a self-ruled state with a democratically elected government, a population of 2.3 million, and territories including the mountainous island of Taiwan some 100 kilometers from Mainland China and several outlying islands, including Jinmen (Kinmen, Quimoy, 金門) and Mazu (Matsu 馬祖) just off the coast of the Chinese province of Fujian. During the Cold-War Era, Taiwan, along with South Korea and South Vietnam constitute the front line of military conflict between the US-led and the Soviet-led camps in their global rivalry (while Japan, Thailand and the Philippines the second-line logistic bases for the US camp). There have not been any real military conflict between Taiwan and Mainland China for decades, though. Instead, millions of people travel, go to school, do business, get married between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
		<p>The political status of Taiwan is a complex and much-disputed issue. Taiwan maintains the official name Republic of China (ROC), which was established in 1911 after the a revolution overthrew the Qing Empire of China and subsequently replaced in the mainland by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) after the Chinese Civil War between 1945 and 1949. Very few countries recognize Taiwan diplomatically, even fewer people believe in the official territorial claim of ROC over entire China. Renouncing the name, however, is currently impossible as PRC strongly oppose any claim of Taiwan Independence, even though the territories of modern-day Taiwan have never been ruled by the PRC since its founding in 1949. Participants of the 9th CENA are welcomed to explore this complex issue with your new Taiwanese friends.</p>
		<p>Putting the issue of political status aside, there are much more social, cultural and political issues in Taiwan today that are strongly connected with issues in other East Asian and Southeast Asian Countries. We have selected five issues and produced this course pack as an introduction to the sites we will visit in the 9th CENA Summer School, and the social movements and political issues in contemporary Taiwan.</p>
		<p>The island of Taiwan was originally inhabited by dozens of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples. The languages of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples are closely related to the Austronesian languages spoken in Maritime Southeast Asia, Polynesia, New Zealand, and Madagascar. The Dutch East India Company was the first outside power to establish something like a modern state in Taiwan in 1624, after it had solidify its power in modern-day Indonesia. A Chinese force loyal to the Ming dynasty defeated and expelled the Dutch in 1662. Qing dynasty forces took Taiwan in 1683, and ruled the island for some 200 years. Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895, after the Qing dynasty was defeated in the Sino-Japanese War fought over the issue of suzerainty over the Kingdom of Korea. Taiwan therefore became the first official colony of Imperial Japan. (Ryukyu/Okinawa had a similar fate but was regarded as part of Japan proper.) While the fifty-year-long colonial rule has witnessed a lot of uprisings, resistance and state violence, it transformed Taiwan into a semi-industrialized society, especially toward the end of the colonial period when Japan prepared to launch even larger military expansion to China and Southeast Asia (and eventually led to WWII in the Pacifics).</p>
		<p>After Japan’s defeat in WWII in 1945, Taiwan was reverted to the Republic of China, which has been at war with Japan since 1937. The Chinese Civil War soon started throughout China, which now included Taiwan, and the military and political struggles between right-wing Nationalist (Kuomingtang, KMT 國民黨） and left-wing Communist also had its presence in Taiwan. After its defeat in the mainland in 1949, KMT withdrew most of its forces to Taiwan. Martial law was declared in Taiwan on May 20, 1949 and never lifted until July 14, 1987. The outbreak of Korean War in June 1950 brought KMT military support from the United States against its communist rival. This directly led to years of anti-communist campaign in Taiwan known as the White Terror. The number of victims of the White Terror is still not fully known. The White Terror and the 38-year-long martial law is still within the living memory of many Taiwanese today, shaping politics and social movements on the island.</p>
		<p>The lifting of martial law in July 1987 was a result of a long struggle for democracy by the people of Taiwan. This democratic movement is contemporary with that in South Korea and the Philippines. Full democracy did not come right away, though. The parliament was not fully elected by the people until 1991, and the president was not elected by direct vote until 1996. First change of ruling party took place in 2000, when the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential election. KMT took back the administration 8 years later, only to lose again to DPP in 2016 and 2020. While many reforms took place in this period of democracy, they are almost always hard won by people’s struggle on many aspects of social-political lives in Taiwan: from labor rights to environmental protection, from human right to preservation of historical memory.</p>

	<ol>
		<h2><li>February 28 Incident</h2>
			<p>The main venue of the 9th CENA will be at the National 228 Memorial Museum. People’s uprising on February 28, 1947 was a spontaneous protest against the corruption and police brutality of the KMT government which took over Taiwan in 1945. Initially the Chinese government and army were widely welcomed by the Taiwanese people as liberator from the Japanese colonial rule. People soon got disillusioned and took up arms in the 228 uprising, but brutally suppressed weeks later. What is most remarkable about the 228 incidence is that no one was allowed to mention it throughout the 38-year-long martial law even though most people still remember it first hand. The right to talk about this incidence was one of the central issues of the democratic struggle of the 1980s. </p>

		<h2><li>White Terror</h2>
			<p>Similar to what happened to the 228 Incident, the White Terror starting in 1950 was a forbidden subject during the martial-law years. Thousands of political prisoners was arrested, tortured, executed, or imprisoned all the way into the 1980s. Their family and friends was afraid to talk about them for fear of government suppression. It was only in the 1990s that mass graveyards of executed political prisoners were discovered, and in the 2000s, former prisons and detention facilities turned into national memorials.</p>

		<h2><li>KINKASEKI Camp</h2>
			<p>The Kinkaseki Camp issue really illustrates the complicated layers of history Taiwanese people have experienced. Today, Jinguashi (金瓜石, or Kinkaseki in Japanee) seems like a sleepy neighbor to the bustling tourist attraction of Jiufen (九份). However, from 1942 to 1945, it was the site of one of the worst Japanese POW camps in WWII. Thousands of malnutritioned British, American, Canadian, Australian and New Zealander prisoners of war was worked to death in the copper mine there. Surviving POWs and family of those died in the camp started to go back to Kinkaseki for remembrance in the 1990s. Local Taiwanese, though, was not invited to their yearly memorial services, as many of their prison guards was Taiwanese.</p>
			<p>Historical memories of Taiwanese residents of Jinguashi/Kinkaseki is quite different from the Allied POWs. They have been migrant workers coming from all of Taiwan or even southern China to work at the copper mine since the 1900s. Unlike in Jufen where gold-digging turned into a wild-west scene with many small entrepreneurs got rich though stroke of luck, people in Jinguashi were company employees living in a company town.</p>
			<p>The copper mine was owned by Japanese corporation and later taken over by the KMT government’s state enterprise. In 1941, more than a hundred Jinguashi residents were rounded up, tortured and imprisoned by the Japanese Political Police (特高) on suspicion that they sympathize with China. They were never legally charged with anything, but at least 33 were confirmed dead either in the hands of the police, or died in the allied bombing toward the end of war while they were still in police detention. The death toll may be more than a hundred. Aside from this group of victims of Japanese White Terror, vast majority of the workers in Jinguashi was also seriously starving and suffering hard labor, as all available food stock was seized to feed the military. When the POW walk through the winding steep footpath to the mine, Taiwanese workers were ordered to turn away and not looking at them. “They are like ghosts passing behind my back: lanky, starving, dress in rags, and pale like ghosts.” </p>
			<p>Thus, even though local residents and the Allied POWs share a period of sad history side by side during the war, there was not much interactions between them. They were not even allowed to look at each others’ suffering. It was only in recent decade that surviving Allied POWs started to understand that the Taiwanese they hated then were not much better off then they were, and the story of the Kinkaseki POW camp started to become part of local history in the minds of residents of Jinguashi.</p>

		<h2><li>Losheng Sanatorium</h2>
			<p>Losheng Sanotarium is one of many “lepers’ colonies” build by The Japanese govenrment in Korea and Taiwan. Colonial powers at the time build similar facility to quarantine patients of Hansen’s Disease, previously  known as leprosy. The ROC government in Taiwan took over and carry on the same policy against leprosy. Because of the stigma against “lepers,” and because leprosy was wrongly believed to be highly contagious, and no effective medicine can cure or control it, a patient’s stay is usually for life. Many residents in Losheng remembered how they were dragged from home as teenagers after getting diagnosed as with leprosy, shipped to Losheng, and being told that the only way out was through the tunnel of the crematorium, after they die. In the 1980s and 1990s, the scientific world started to admit that Hansen’s disease is not easily transmitted, and new and effective drugs were developed. It seems thousands of lives squandered in this prison-like sanatorium is for nothing after all.</p>
			<p>Discovering this piece of Taiwan history of flagrant human right abuses in the name of public health was already shocking for some students in the early-2000s. Later, they found out that the government wanted to demolish most of the old buildings and big trees in the sanatorium and build a Taipei Metro Rail Yard. The Losheng residents, suffered throughout their lives, will be evicted from the place they already call home now. The obviou injustice in the issue started to attract mainly young supporters to campaign for preservation of the Sanatorium, and for the government to apologize and compensate the victims. This however, clashed with the Metro rail yard project, and clashes between volunteers defending the Sanatorium residents and riot police trying to clear the buildings for demolition waged on for years. Today, the struggle is still going on, albeit in a more subdued form.</p>

		<h2><li>Anti-Nuclear Power</h2>
			<p>The anti-nuclear in Taiwan is one of the longest social-movement campaigns in Taiwan. The construction of 3 nuclear power plants in the 1970s (2 on the North Coast and 1 next to a national park in the south) was regarded by the KMT government of national pride and a symbol of modernization. It did not meet much public scrutiny until the Chernobyl Disaster starting on April 23, 1986. Residents near the construction site of the 4th Nuclear Power Plant in Gongliao on the north coast started to build coalition with academics who were already alarmed by the Three Mile Island Accident in the US in 1979. The call for abolishing nuclear power came to symbolize Taiwanese people’s democratic resistance against the technocratic dictatorship of KMT. That is part of reason why DPP, founded in September 1986, chose green as its party color. Construction of the 4th Nuclear Plant was not stopped, even after DPP won the general election in 2000, as the Taiwanese government was reluctant to offend the two most powerful contractors of the project and the governments behind them: General Electric of the US and Toshiba of Japan.</p>
			<p>The anti-nuclear-power movement persevere on through the low tide years, keep on protesting, monitoring, and grassroots education campaigns. After the Fukushima Disaster of 2011, abolishing nuclear power finally became a majority opinion among Taiwanese people. It was after three more years of mass protest that the government finally decided to stop construction of the 4th Nuclear Power Plant, and gradually phase out the existing three. The nuclear waste problem after decommission, however, has no solution in sight, and residents living near the nuclear plant sites still live in high uncertainty. The nuclear-power issue was revived in the 2018 election, when supporters of nuclear power, mostly KMT supporters who regard abolishing nuclear power as a DPP partisan policy, put the issue to national referendum, and won a majority for their proposal. The referendum was not regarded as conclusive because the proposal voted on was written in a convoluted language and people cannot agree on exactly what it means.</p>
